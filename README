This is a very poorly written Hitfaker for Browsergames or Votingsystems.
You can use it with a proxy list. The proxy list should have this format:
127.0.0.1:80
128.0.0.1:8080
and so on...

How to use it?
1. Download the hitfaker.jar file and a proxy list (here is a nice blog for proxy lists: http://fresh-proxylists.blogspot.de/)
2. Open the terminal and type in: 
	java -jar hitfaker.jar http://THEURL.COM proxies.txt 20 
 
 	1. Parameter: URL you want to hit
 	2. Parameter: The proxy list
 	3. Parameter: Threads (Parallel Connections) 

I know it's not the best program but it will do the trick for normal hitfakes with GET
