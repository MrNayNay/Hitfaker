This is a very poorly written Hitfaker for Browsergames or Votingsystems.

You can use it with a proxy list. The proxy list should have this format:

	127.0.0.1:80
	128.0.0.1:8080

**How to use it?**

1. Download the [hitfaker.jar](https://github.com/nicolas-dular/Hitfaker/blob/master/hitfaker.jar) file and a proxy list (here is a nice blog for proxy lists: [http://fresh-proxylists.blogspot.de/](http://fresh-proxylists.blogspot.de/))

2. Open the terminal and type in: 

	`java -jar hitfaker.jar http://MYURL.COM proxies.txt 20`
 
	1. Parameter: URL you want to hit
	2. Parameter: The proxy list
	3. Parameter: Threads (Parallel Connections) 

I know it's not the best program but it will do the trick for normal hitfakes with GET
